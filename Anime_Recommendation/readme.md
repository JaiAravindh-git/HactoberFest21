# Anime Recommendation System

This folder includes 2 Machine Learning models that recommends 10 animes similar to the anime that you have entered into the model
The models primarily are based on 2 different ideas:
- The first model is based on Correlation between anime where the most correlated anime are suggested to you. Infact this model is pretty accurate and has an accuracy of around 70%-80% with a dataset of only 4400 animes.
- The second model is based on the concept of Text Vectorisation implemented with Bag of Word (BoW) method. Then the cosine similarity with all other animes are found and the 10 nearest vectors(similar anime) are given to you. As od now this model is very basic and a bit inaccurate and there is scope of improvement.

# Before you start
Download ```rating.csv``` from ```https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database?select=rating.csv``` and put it in your working directory. Its too large to add to the repository.
