/* LeetCode - 2028 FIND MISSING OBSERVATIONS

QIUESTION --- 

You have observations of n + m 6-sided dice rolls with each face numbered from 1 to 6. n of the observations went missing, and you only have the observations of m rolls.
Fortunately, you have also calculated the average value of the n + m rolls.

You are given an integer array rolls of length m where rolls[i] is the value of the ith observation. You are also given the two integers mean and n.

Return an array of length n containing the missing observations such that the average value of the n + m rolls is exactly mean.
If there are multiple valid answers, return any of them. If no such array exists, return an empty array.

The average value of a set of k numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by k.

Note that mean is an integer, so the sum of the n + m rolls should be divisible by n + m.

Example :-

Input: rolls = [3,2,4,3], mean = 4, n = 2
Output: [6,6]
Explanation: The mean of all n + m rolls is (3 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 6 + 6) / 6 = 4.

// SOLUTION

    vector<int> missingRolls(vector<int>& rolls, int mean, int n) {
        
        vector<int> ans;
        int m = rolls.size();
        long long sum = (m + n) * mean;   // total sum
        
        for(int i=0; i<m; i++)
        {
            sum -= rolls[i];             // remaining sum
        }
        
        if(sum < n || sum > n*6) return {};   // its not possible
        
        while(n>0)
        {
            if(sum==n)
            {
                ans.push_back(1);
                n--;
                sum--;
            }
            else
            {
                int temp = min((long long)6, sum - n + 1);
                sum -= temp;
                n--;
                ans.push_back(temp);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
